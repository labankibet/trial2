# Bank Transaction Manager

A simple web application built with React to manage bank transactions. This project demonstrates the use of components, props, state, events, and data fetching from a JSON database using Axios.

## Features

- Display a table of bank transactions.
- Add new transactions using a form.
- Filter transactions by description using a search bar.
- Fetch transaction data from a JSON database (db.json).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
- JSON Server installed globally (`npm install -g json-server`) if you intend to use it.

## Acknowledgments
This project was created to demonstrate the use of React for building a simple bank transaction manager. It can serve as a foundation for more complex web applications.
